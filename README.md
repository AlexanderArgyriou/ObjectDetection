# ObjectDetection
* C++/WinRT AI/ML Computer Vision Project for object detection.
* The Project uses Window's AI APIs.
* The pretrained model which is used: (SqueezeNet deep neural network https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SqueezeNet).
* Works well with 224 x 224 pictures(max)(Bigger Scale - Worse performance).
* U can use your own pictures to test the model and it's results.
* Define the file path of your picture as a string object in main(), call the ProcessModel function, and .... voil√†.
* Fun Pictures for testing included.
* Thumbs up to Microsfost AI Docs and SqueezeNet.
