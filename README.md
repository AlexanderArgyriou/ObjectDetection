# ObjectDetection
* C++/WinRT AI/ML Computer Vision Project for object detection.
* The Project uses Window's AI APIs.
* The pretrained model which is used: (SqueezeNet deep neural network https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SqueezeNet).
* Works well with 224 x 224 pictures(max)(Bigger Scale - Worse performance).
* U can use your own pictures to test the model and it's results.
* Define the file path of your picture as a string object in main(), call the ProcessModel function, and .... voil√†.
* Fun Pictures for testing included.
* Thumbs up to Microsfost AI Docs and SqueezeNet.
* C++17 or C++20.

# Update
* URL: 
* Created, Designed and Deployed a GUI in Qt/C++ to control the Computer Vision Project Above.
* The DeployedMLAppQtGui Folder, contains the deployed .exe with all libraries(tested on windows 10).
* Contains the code for the GUI at ComputerVisionAndObjectDetection subfolder.
* Contains the code for C++/WinRT AI/ML Computer Vision Project at ML_Object_Detection subfolder.

# Video
* The video contained, shows everything u need to handle and use the Project.
